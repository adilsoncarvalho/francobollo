A more organized view of the available stamps @ Correios On-line Shop (Brazil)

The main issue with the official stamps store for the Brazilian Postal Service (Correios) is that is doesn't
allow the user to do very basic queries.

My personal case: I write a lot of letter to pen pals all over the world and currently I need stamps for Americas (`R$3.55`),
Western Europe (`R$4.25`) and Asia (`R$4.50`). It's impossible to finde those prices quickly at Correios because they only
present stamps as `R$22.40 (with 12 stamps)`, with no unit prices on a filter.

As most of my mail go to the USA, I need a base `R$3.55` stamp and two other to complement the value when the letter goes
to Europe or Asia. So far I've done that manually but it takes more time than it's worth.

The goal here is to have a handy crawler that brings all the options on their website to allow choosing by unit price.


> francobollo stands for _stamp_ in Italian.
